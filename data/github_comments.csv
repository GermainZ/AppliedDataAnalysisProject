re: testing, I added one unit test but it's far from comprehensive; it seems pretty hard to unit test this area of the code. I tested this mostly on a real cluster, with a low-priority app running long tasks being preempted by a quick-running high priority app. Tasks were preempted in the long-running app, and even with several preemption cycles, the app eventually finished successfully.

142811363,"Thank you @andrewor14 for the explanation. I believe you're talking about to reserve the data page in advanced via the `UnsafeFixedWidthAggregationMap.map` (BytesToBytesMap), which will reserve the data page in its constructor. 
Everything looks reasonable to me now, the only concern is the performance, since only a single data page available for the sort-based aggregation. Anyway, it's not related to this fix.
